# 🍷 Wine Quality ML Mini Project

An end-to-end supervised machine learning pipeline for wine quality classification, incorporating exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a wine sample is GOOD or BAD based on its physicochemical properties using classification algorithms.

The original wine quality score was converted into a binary target:
- GOOD (1) → Quality ≥ 7  
- BAD (0) → Quality < 7
